# Betting with Friends App

I'd like to use the readme file as a place to show diagrams and share links. Tony, please add links to the talks you watched.

## Communication

How do we want to do communication? We can use Github issues for specific software issues. [Github projects](https://github.com/adhurjaty/prediction-app/projects/1) is a good Kanban board for communicating current state of tasks. Google calendars works for everyone for scheduling meetings? How do we want to do day-to-day communication. I prefer texting -- I'm not usually that responsive to email and I often forget about emails. We could start a Whatsapp group? What do you guys prefer?

### [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/l9ut96y0hhfi9cqbxNSx94/Untitled?node-id=4%3A55)

If you want to edit the Figma diagram, open your own instance of Figma and import the PredictApp.fig file, make edits, save over it and commit.
