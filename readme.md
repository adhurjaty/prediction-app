# Betting with Friends App

I'd like to use the readme file as a place to show diagrams and share links. Tony, please add links to the talks you watched.

## Communication

How do we want to do communication? We can use Github issues for specific software issues. [Github projects](https://github.com/adhurjaty/prediction-app/projects/1) is a good Kanban board for communicating current state of tasks. Google calendars works for everyone for scheduling meetings? How do we want to do day-to-day communication. I prefer texting -- I'm not usually that responsive to email and I often forget about emails. We could start a Whatsapp group? What do you guys prefer?

If you want to edit the Figma diagram, open your own instance of Figma and import the PredictApp.fig file, make edits, save over it and commit.
