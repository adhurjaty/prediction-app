# Notes 2021-03-16

## Progress

- UML diagramming
- UI prototyping
- Solidity/Blockchain research

## Next Steps

- Get second blockchain test to pass
- Tony to continue with Hello World local blockchain
- Let's all do a Ganache/HardHat tutorial
- Deployment Ether networks
  - MainNet -- Main ether network
  - Dev nets
- Local networks
  - Ganache
  - Waffle
- Look into Solidity events

### UI

- Proposition page shows boolean of whether member has placed bet and the bet amount

## Long Term

- Simple binary betting for the first iteration
  - All bets have a constant ante

## Questions

- How should we allow users to bet
- Should we store any data related to the blockchain (user addresses, event information, etc) in the backend?
