# Notes 2021-03-30

- Where to put the blockchain, public accessibility
  - Do we want to use a public testnet?
  - Testnets are cheap for us and mimic the mainnet
- Mining stuff?
- Testnets make sense to use, let's just figure out the details and if we're getting screwed somehow

## Stuff by next week

- Set up basic Vue frontend to talk with the testnet
  - Dan & Anil
- Research the testnet and deploy propositions
  - Tony
    - https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/12129/why-cant-i-deploy-a-dapp-on-the-testnet
    - Summary of testnet downsides:
      - No incentives for the miners to keep the network running
      - Sometimes the network gets 'polluted' and the whole thing gets reset
- Better Figma mockups
  - Dan

## Questions

- How do we handle the wallet / private keys?


## Longterm

- Composable resolutions
- DB schema
